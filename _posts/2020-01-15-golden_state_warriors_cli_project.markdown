Hello guys, this was my first prjoect that I did to showcase some of the skills learned and it was amazing!
I created a command line interface gem that scrapes data from the espn website and shows users essential information about every player they always wanted to know. You'll be able to see their age, college, salary, height weight and more!

The cli has a very smooth flow to it and is quite dry in not repeating certain code as well. I feel anyone who likes basketball or wants to experience a cli gem would love this app as well!

Also if you'll like a deep dive of how I made the content of the gem, please click this link for a full explanation!
