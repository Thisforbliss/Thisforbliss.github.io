	Ok, so isn't cool to make something out of nothing. Just look around, how did you get back home? Car, bike or train? Someone invented that. How did you let your friend know to meet you at the cafe at 6 pm? Through a call, text or smoke signal? Well, someone invented that method as well! Nowadays ever I feel the world is on a technology boom and would stay that way for some time. So I, Malcolm Leake would like to add value to the world in this amazing journey we're experiencing day by day.
	There are so many ideas I've had in my head that I always use to say. Ah hah! Well, if only I knew how to write code maybe I could make that app or website. And then sometimes I would see that idea comet to life under a different start name. That had me think if they could do it, why can't I? And here I am.
