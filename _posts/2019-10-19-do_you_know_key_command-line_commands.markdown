The content of your blog post goes here.	Welcome to Command-Line Hero's, This is your host Malcolm Leake with yet another adventure into the world of coding! Haha, I can't take full credit for that amazing introduction since I got it from former alumni of ours at FlatIron who hosts her two of her own podcasts and one being named Command-Line Heros.
	Let's dive into some key concepts of command-line applications, shall we? The internet that we know today, the act of clicking to go to one place to another wasn't always that way. Not until Apple made an operating system that hosted that type of feature in the in 1984. 
	Before then we had to directly interact with the computer via the command line. This was the way to migrate to different files or folder by using certain actions like  "cd" "ls" and "pwd". Let me explain what they do.
	Sooo, the purpose of typing "cd" into the command line id to be able to change the directory you were currently in. For example, if you wanted to go to the car directory. You'll type "cd /car" instead of clicking on the "car" folder itself.
	Now let's say you're currently into the car folder, how do we see the actual files contained within the folder? This is where "ls" comes in handy. We use "ls" in the command line to list the current files within that directory. This is the same action as clicking on the folder and seeing all available files within.
	So now we learned how to get into a certain directory using "cd" and to be able to list all files within that directory with "ls" but what if we want to understand where we are within a certain to know how to migrate to a different directory? This is were "pwd" comes into play, we'll use this to print the full pathname of the working directory so we could understand how to migrate to another.
	So these are just a  couple of scenarios of key concepts used in command lines and how to be able to move around via a command line. I hope this helps newbies and I'll see you next time on my other blogs.
Cheers
