So for my interesting problem while using arrays its to know what the array could actually be stored in so you properly call a function on it. When I deal with responses coming from my backend and I know its an array so I try to use .map on it and it doesnt work. That is because the array could be inside of an object which would make it harder to reach it.

But I love using arrays. Its the best and vital to understand how to use methods with them. You could have an array of objects, strings or intergers all at your command. With the power of mapping. You could form the data in any which way you'll want to display it to the end user.
