I remember the times I use to see people write about alogorithims. i would read it and always thiught it was such a cool thing to be able to develop such a thing. How did they do it? It was always so magical to me and also a reason that lead me into the rabbit hole of coding.

Before joining into flatiron i would see people weite code, usually in python i presume for trading algos on tradingview.com. They would write, what seemed like these complex code to predict the trend direction of a tickers price. 

I always thought that would be an interesting skill to compliment my trading ability but didn't know where to start. That moment was a key moment to me to want to pick up coding to be able to understand higher complexities I had no knowledge of.

Fast forward to now, I understand that an algo is simply a long list of variables and methods. Let's break that down.

A method designs the behavior of an object and a variable saves that instance of data you would lime to reuse later.

So lets say you have a "price" which is going to be your object. You would use methods within the the model to mold the price to show a trend direction with other data saved in variables such as time. So we never actually lose the "time" we save in inside of a variable to use later. time  = 4:33 pm. 

NOW with this information, we could massage the data with methods to make it show the type of behavior we're looking for. And there you have it, a small intro into methods and vatiables.
