I had  agreat time creating this application. It felt good using both frontend and backend skills to host a page in front of a user to interact with. My personal growth in coding is apparent because when I started coding, it felt like a new language and I have understanding of it. So I  decided to have my project be based on a real life scenario hundreds of thousands of people face in NYC. That is finding FREE PARKING!!!

Finding free parking is literally an 'art'. You have to know where to go at the exact time to optimize your chances of getting a spot; while being able to read the car in front of you to tell if theyrelooking for a spot as well or if they're simple trying to get to their destination. Even though you might gain some experience to make finding a spot easier by those two variable above, wouldn't it be cool if there was an app for this??? 

Thus the Sinatra Parking-App is born! It takes in user data of the type of car they have, location, contact and their expected time of departure so you guys could switch spots if its appropiate for you! What a life saver! The full breakdown of how it works can be found in this link here https://youtu.be/p7f_dC1IuGE.

Enjoy,
